JP Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience

As part of the JP Morgan Virtual Experience, I:

<ul>
  <li>Interfaced with a stock price data feed and set up system for analysis of the data. </li>
    <li>Implemented the Perspective open-source code in preparation for data visualization. </li>
  <li>Used Perspective to create the cart for the traderâ€™s dashboard. </li>
</ul>
  
  
In this video, I explain the changes made to the graph and what I learned.
